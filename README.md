## Overview

Language server for Package.swift files that provides:

- Smart code completion for Package.swift manifest files:
  - In `.package(...)` function:
    - `url:` argument with GitHub repository suggestions
    - `from:` and `exact:` arguments with version suggestions
    - `branch:` argument with available branch names
  - In `.product(...)` function:
    - `name:` argument with available product suggestions from dependencies
    - `package:` argument with package name suggestions
  - In `.target(...)` function:
    - `name:` argument with local target name suggestions from your package
  - In target dependencies string literals:
    - Product name completion that automatically expands to `.product(name: "ProductName", package: "PackageName")` format
    - Local target name completion for referencing targets within your package to `.target(name: "LocalTarget")` format
> [!NOTE]
> After editing package dependencies (`.package(...)`), save the file for changes to be reflected in target completions.

- Contextual hover information:
  - Package details including location and state when hovering over package names
  - Available products in the package

## Installation & Editor Integration

The easiest way to get started is through editor extensions:

- **[Zed](https://zed.dev/)**: Install the [Package.swift LSP extension](https://github.com/kattouf/package-swift-lsp-zed) from the Zed extension marketplace
> [!NOTE]
> For proper Swift language server functionality in non-Package.swift files, configure the language server order in your Zed settings:
> ```json
> {
>   "languages": {
>     "Swift": {
>       "language_servers": ["sourcekit-lsp", "package-swift-lsp"]
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**: Install the [Package.swift LSP extension](https://github.com/kattouf/package-swift-lsp-vscode) from the VSCode marketplace

Support for additional editors (Vim, Emacs, etc.) is planned. If you'd like to see support for your preferred editor, please submit a feature request or consider contributing!

The LSP server binary can also be downloaded directly from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/kattouf/package-swift-lsp/releases/latest).
